An adaptive operating system implementation based on machine learning and user experience proactive decisions.

## Brief Description

The idea in brief is to develop an open source operating system that can be adaptive to the user experience and the usage considering various features to be taken into account in order to predict the behavoir of the user with the OS in way where we could optimise the performance (where each user could operate in the system with different behavoir).

## Basic implementation

The naive way is to generate a classification problem where the OS classify the user actions into a category where this catgeory could be treated with an existing algorithm for proccess and memory scheduling.And the further approach is to design an algorithm that could predict the user's actions based on his experience.
